Project Title: PhonePe App – Pixel Perfect UI Clone (React Native)

Goal:
Create a pixel-by-pixel accurate clone of the PhonePe app landing/home page UI using React Native. This is a UI/UX-focused assignment, not a backend or payments implementation.

I am attaching the latest UI screenshots of the official PhonePe app along with this prompt.
You must strictly match the screenshots visually.

Core Requirements
1. Technology Stack

React Native

Use Expo if needed (preferred for quick setup)

JavaScript (not TypeScript unless required)

No backend or real API calls

2. UI Accuracy (VERY IMPORTANT)

The UI must be a pixel-by-pixel replica of the provided PhonePe screenshots

Match exactly:

Layout and spacing

Colors (backgrounds, gradients, icons)

Font family, font weight, and font size

Button shapes, border radius, shadows

Icon sizes and positions

Use Flexbox properly to achieve exact alignment

Use Dimensions / PixelRatio where needed to match spacing precisely

3. Scope of Screens to Clone

Clone only the landing/home screen, including:

Header (wallet balance, profile, notifications, scanner icon)

Scanner section

Quick action buttons (Send Money, Recharge, Pay Bills, etc.)

Merchant/payment sections

Offers / banners (static mock)

Bottom navigation bar (Home, Stores, Insurance, Wealth, History or equivalent)

4. Interactivity & Mock Functionality

Even though no backend is required:

Make most buttons and icons clickable

Use:

TouchableOpacity / Pressable

Mock navigation (e.g., Alert, console.log, or dummy screens)

Clicking actions should:

Open mock screens OR

Show placeholder modals OR

Log meaningful actions (e.g., “Scanner opened”, “Send Money clicked”)

5. Mocked Sections (Must Include)

Create proper UI mocks for:

📷 PhonePe Scanner

Camera UI mock (no real camera access required)

Scanner frame overlay

“Scan any QR” text

👤 Accounts Section

Bank accounts/cards layout

Balance placeholders

Account tiles styled like PhonePe

6. Assets & Icons

You may:

Use placeholder images

Use vector icons (Ionicons / MaterialIcons / custom SVGs)

Real PhonePe assets are not required, but:

Visual resemblance must be extremely close

Icons do not need real functionality

7. Code Quality & Structure

Clean folder structure:

components/

screens/

assets/

Reusable components for:

Buttons

Icon tiles

Sections

Use StyleSheet (no inline styles)

Comment the code where necessary

8. Navigation

Use React Navigation

Bottom tab navigation should visually match PhonePe

Navigation destinations can be dummy screens

9. Explicit Constraints

❌ No backend

❌ No authentication

❌ No real payments

❌ No real camera or QR scanning

✅ UI accuracy is the top priority

10. Final Deliverable Expectations

App should run without errors in Replit

Home screen should look indistinguishable from the real PhonePe app

All major UI elements should be clickable

Code should be readable and well-structured

Important Note:
I have attached the latest PhonePe UI screenshots.
You must use them as the single source of truth for spacing, sizing, colors, and layout.
